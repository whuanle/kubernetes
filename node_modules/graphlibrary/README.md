# Graphlibrary

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/tylingsoft/graphlibrary.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/tylingsoft/graphlibrary)

Graphlibrary is a JavaScript library that provides data structures for undirected and directed multi-graphs along with algorithms that can be used with them.

Graphlibrary is not built from scratch, it's based on [dagrejs/graphlib](https://github.com/dagrejs/graphlib). And it is designed as an out-of-box replacement for dagrejs/graphlib.
